# Download and installation

## Requirements

Calliope is tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Running Calliope requires four things:

1. The Python programming language, version {{ min_python_version }} to {{ max_python_version }}.
2. A number of Python add-on modules including [Pyomo](https://www.pyomo.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/).
3. An optimisation solver: Calliope has been tested with CBC, GLPK, and Gurobi.
   Any other solver that is compatible with Pyomo should also work.
4. The Calliope software itself.

## Recommended installation method

The easiest way to get a working Calliope installation is to use the free `mamba` package manager, which can install all of the four things described above in a single step.

To get `mamba`, the most straightforward approach is to [download and install the "Miniforge" distribution for your operating system](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html).

!!! tip

    Another option is to use the commercially developed [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download), which is available for all operating systems and comes with a graphical user interface to install and manage packages.
    If you use the Anaconda distribution, you have to replace `mamba` with `conda` in the installation instructions below.

With the package manager installed, you can create a new environment called `calliope` with Calliope as well as the free and open source CBC solver.
Run the following command in a terminal or command-line window:

```shell
mamba create -n calliope -c conda-forge conda-forge/label/calliope_dev::calliope
```

!!! note
    The `conda-forge/label/calliope_dev` channel allows you to access the pre-release of Calliope v0.7, with which this version of the documentation aligns.
    To install the most recent _stable_ version of Calliope, see our [v0.6.10 documentation](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.10/).

This will install calliope with Python version {{ max_python_version }}.

To use Calliope, you need to activate the `calliope` environment each time

```bash
mamba activate calliope
```

!!! warning

    Although possible, we do not recommend installing Calliope directly via `pip` (`pip install calliope`).
    Non-python binaries are not installed with `pip`, some of which are necessary for stable operation (e.g., `libnetcdf`).

## Choosing a solver

You cannot solve a Calliope model until you have installed a solver.
The easiest solver to install is [CBC](#cbc), which is included if you follow the [recommended installation instructions](#recommended-installation-method) above.
[CBC](#cbc) (open-source) or [Gurobi](#gurobi) (commercial) are recommended for large problems, and have been confirmed to work with Calliope.
The following subsections provide additional detail on how to install a solver.
This list is not exhaustive; any solvers [supported by Pyomo](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/topical/appsi/appsi.solvers.html) can be used.

### CBC

[CBC](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc) is our recommended option if you want a free and open-source solver.
If you do not have it in your working environment (i.e. there is nothing listed when you call `conda list cbc`) then it can be installed by running `mamba install conda-forge::coin-or-cbc`.

### GLPK

[GLPK](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/glpk) is free and open-source, but can take too much time and/or too much memory on larger problems.
`GLPK` can be installed from `conda-forge` on all platforms: `mamba install conda-forge::glpk`.
Unlike [CBC](#cbc), it is possible to extract [shadow prices](./advanced/shadow_prices.md) from a model solved with GLPK, which is why you may with to use it instead of CBC.

### Gurobi

[Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) is commercial but significantly faster than CBC and GLPK, which is relevant for larger problems.
It needs a license to work, which [can be obtained for free for academic use](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).

The Gurobi solver interface can be installed via conda (`mamba install gurobi::gurobi`).

After installing, log on to the [Gurobi website](https://www.gurobi.com/) and obtain a (free academic or paid commercial) license, then activate it on your system via the instructions given online (using the `grbgetkey` command).

!!! note
    If using the Gurobi solver, you can also leverage the reduced time and memory consumption of our [Gurobi optimisation problem backend](advanced/backend_choice.md) - this circumvents Pyomo entirely.

### CPLEX

Another commercial alternative is [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio).
IBM offer academic licenses for CPLEX. Refer to the IBM website for details.
