## Developing Calliope

To find beginner-friendly existing bugs and feature requests you may like to start out with, take a look at our [good first issues](https://github.com/calliope-project/calliope/contribute).

Look at our [milestones](https://github.com/calliope-project/calliope/milestones) and [projects](https://github.com/calliope-project/calliope/projects) on GitHub for an idea on where development is headed.

### Setting up a development environment

To create a development environment for calliope, with all libraries required for development and quality assurance installed, it is easiest to install calliope using the [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package manager, as follows:

1. Install mamba with the [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) executable for your operating system.
1. Open the command line (or the "miniforge prompt" in Windows).
1. Download (a.k.a., clone) the calliope repository: `git clone git@github.com:calliope-project/calliope.git`
1. Change into the `calliope` directory: `cd calliope`
1. Create the calliope mamba environment: `mamba create -n calliope -c conda-forge --file requirements/base.txt --file requirements/dev.txt`
1. Activate the calliope mamba environment: `mamba activate calliope`
1. Install the calliope package into the environment, in editable mode and ignoring dependencies (we have dealt with those when creating the mamba environment): `pip install --no-deps -e .`

All together:

``` shell
git clone git@github.com:calliope-project/calliope.git
cd calliope
mamba create -n calliope -c conda-forge --file requirements/base.txt
mamba activate calliope
pip install --no-deps -e .
```

If installing directly with pip, you can install these libraries using the `dev` option, i.e., `pip install -e '.[dev]'`

If you plan to make changes to the code then please make regular use of the following tools to verify the codebase while you work:

- `pre-commit`: run `pre-commit install` in your command line to load inbuilt checks that will run every time you commit your changes.
The checks are: 1. check no large files have been staged, 2. lint python files for major errors, 3. format python files to conform with the [PEP8 standard](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
You can also run these checks yourself at any time to ensure staged changes are clean by calling `pre-commit`.
- `pytest` - run the unit test suite and check test coverage.

!!! note
    If you already have an environment called `calliope` on your system (e.g., for a stable installation of the package), you will need to choose a different environment name, e.g. `calliope-dev`.

## Implementing a change

When you want to change some part of Calliope, whether it is the software or the documentation, it's best to do it in a fork of the main Calliope project repository.
You can find out more about how to fork a repository on [GitHub's help pages](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
Your fork will be a duplicate of the Calliope main branch and can be 'cloned' to provide you with the repository on your own device.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your_username/calliope
```

If you want the local version of your fork to be in the same folder as your local version of the main Calliope repository, then you just need to specify a new directory name:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your_username/calliope your_new_directory_name
```

Following the instructions for [installing a development environment of Calliope](#setting-up-a-development-environment), you can create an environment specific to this installation of Calliope.

In making changes to your local version, it's a good idea to create a branch first, to not have your main branch diverge from that of the main Calliope repository:

```shell
git branch new-fix-or-feature
```

Then, 'checkout' the branch so that the folder contents are specific to that branch:

```shell
git checkout new-fix-or-feature
```

Finally, push the branch online, so its existence is also in your remote fork of the Calliope repository:

```shell
git push -u origin new-fix-or-feature
```

Now the files in your local directory can be edited with complete freedom.
Once you have made the necessary changes, you'll need to test that they don't break anything.
This can be done easily by changing to the directory into which you cloned your fork using the terminal / command line, and running [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/index.html)
Any change you make should also be covered by a test.
Add it into the relevant test file, making sure the function starts with 'test\_'.

If tests are failing, you can debug them by using the pytest arguments ``-x`` (stop at the first failed test) and ``--pdb`` (enter into the debug console).

### Rapid-fire testing

The following options allow you to strip down the test suite to the bare essentials:

1. The test suite includes unit tests and integration tests.
The integration tests can be slow, so if you want to avoid them during development, you should run `pytest -m "not time_intensive"` to ignore those tests flagged as `time_intensive`.
1. You can avoid tracking code coverage (which can be slow), by adding the `--no-cov` argument: `pytest --no-cov`.

All together:

``` shell
pytest -m "not time_intensive" --no-cov
```

If you are developing your own tests, you can focus on those with the `::` syntax:

``` shell
pytest tests/test_my_tests.py::TestMyTestClass::test_my_test_function
```

### Committing changes

Once everything has been updated as you'd like (see the contribution checklist below for more on this), you can commit those changes.
This stores all edited files in the directory, ready for pushing online

```shell
git add .
git checkout -m "Short message explaining what has been done in this commit."
```

If you only want a subset of edited files to go into this commit, you can specify them in the call to `git add`; the period adds all edited files.

If you're happy with your commit(s) then it is time to 'push' everything online using the command `git push`.
If you're working with someone else on a branch and they have made changes, you can bring them into your local repository using the command `git pull`.

Now it is time to request that these changes are added into the main Calliope project repository!
You can do this by starting a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
One of the core Calliope team will review the pull request and either accept it or request some changes before it's merged into the main Calliope repository.
If any changes are requested, you can make those changes on your local branch, commit them, and push them online -- your pull request will update automatically with those changes.

Once a pull request has been accepted, you can return your fork back to its main branch and [sync it](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) with the updated Calliope project `main` branch:

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/calliope-project/calliope
git fetch upstream main
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

## Submitting changes

### Pull requests

Before submitting a pull request, check whether you have:

1. **Test(s) added to cover contribution**.
Tests ensure that a bug you've fixed will be caught in future, if an update to the code causes it to occur again.
They also allow you to ensure that additional functionality works as you expect, and any change elsewhere in the code that causes it to act differently in future will be caught.
2. **Updated the documentation**.
If you've added functionality, it should be mentioned in the documentation. You can find the Markdown files for the documentation in the 'docs' directory.
3. **Updated the changelog**.
A brief description of the bug fixed or feature added should be placed in the changelog (CHANGELOG.md).
Depending on what the pull request introduces, the description should be prepended with `fixed`, `changed`, `added` or `new`.
4. **maintained or improved code coverage**.
Coverage will be shown once all tests are complete online.
It is the percentage of lines covered by at least one test.
If you've added a test or two, you should be fine.
But if coverage does go down it means that not all of your contribution has been tested!

If you're not sure you've done everything to have a fully formed pull request, feel free to start it anyway.
We can help guide you through making the necessary changes, once we have seen where you've got to.

### Commit messages

Please try to write clear commit messages.
One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```plain
A brief summary of the commit

A paragraph or bullet-point list describing what changed and its impact,
covering as many lines as needed.
```

## Code conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it.

We mostly follow the official [Style Guide for Python Code (PEP8)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

We have chosen to use the uncompromising code formatter [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black/) and the linter [`ruff`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/).
When run from the root directory of this repository, `pyproject.toml` should ensure that formatting and linting fixes are in line with our custom preferences (e.g., 88 character maximum line length).
The philosophy behind using `black` is to have uniform style throughout the project dictated by code.
Since `black` is designed to minimise diffs, and make patches more human readable, this also makes code reviews more efficient.
To make this a smooth experience, you should run `pre-commit install` after setting up your development environment, so that `black` makes all the necessary fixes to your code each time you commit, and so that `ruff` will highlight any errors in your code.
If you prefer, you can also set up your IDE to run these two tools whenever you save your files, and to have `ruff` highlight erroneous code directly as you type.
Take a look at their documentation for more information on configuring this.

We require all new contributions to have docstrings for all modules, classes and methods.
When adding docstrings, we request you use the [Google docstring style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).
