# # Defining piecewise linear constraints
#
# In this tutorial, we use the national scale example model to implement a piecewise linear constraint.
# This constraint will represent a non-linear relationship between capacity and cost per unit capacity of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP).

# ## Defining our piecewise curve
#
# In the base national scale model, the CSP has a maximum rated capacity of 10,000 kW and a cost to invest in that capacity of 1000 USD / kW.
#
# In our updated model, the cost to invest in capacity will vary from 5000 USD / kW to 500 USD / kW as the CSP capacity increases:

# %%
capacity_steps = [0, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000]
cost_steps = [0, 3.75e6, 6e6, 7.5e6, 8e6]

cost_per_cap = np.nan_to_num(np.divide(cost_steps, capacity_steps)).astype(int)

fig = px.line(
    x=capacity_steps,
    y=cost_steps,
    labels={"x": "Capacity (kW)", "y": "Investment cost (USD)"},
    markers="o",
    range_y=[0, 10e6],
    text=[f"{i} USD/kW" for i in cost_per_cap],
)
fig.update_traces(textposition="top center")
fig.show()

# We can then provide this data when we load our model:
#
# <div class="admonition note">
#     <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
#     <p>
#         We must index our piecewise data over "breakpoints".

# ## Creating our piecewise constraint
#
# We create the piecewise constraint by linking decision variables to the piecewise curve we have created.
# In this example, we require a new decision variable for investment costs that can take on the value defined by the curve at a given value of `flow_cap`.

# %%
m.math["variables"]["piecewise_cost_investment"] = {
    "description": "Investment cost that increases monotonically",
    "foreach": ["nodes", "techs", "carriers", "costs"],
    "where": "[csp] in techs",
    "bounds": {"min": 0, "max": np.inf},
    "default": 0,
}

# %% [markdown]
# We also need to link that decision variable to our total cost calculation.

# %%
# Before
m.math["global_expressions"]["cost_investment_flow_cap"]["equations"]

# %%
# Updated - we split the equation into two expressions.
m.math["global_expressions"]["cost_investment_flow_cap"]["equations"] = [
    {"expression": "$cost_sum * flow_cap", "where": "NOT [csp] in techs"},
    {"expression": "piecewise_cost_investment", "where": "[csp] in techs"},
]

# %% [markdown]
# We then need to define the piecewise constraint:

# %%
m.math["piecewise_constraints"]["csp_piecewise_costs"] = {
    "description": "Set investment costs values along a piecewise curve using special ordered sets of type 2 (SOS2).",
    "foreach": ["nodes", "techs", "carriers", "costs"],
    "where": "piecewise_cost_investment",
    "x_expression": "flow_cap",
    "x_values": "capacity_steps",
    "y_expression": "piecewise_cost_investment",
    "y_values": "cost_steps",
}

# %% [markdown]
# Then we can build our optimisation problem:

# %% [markdown]
# # Building and checking the optimisation problem
#
# With our piecewise constraint defined, we can build our optimisation problem

# %%
m.build()

# %% [markdown]
# And we can see that our piecewise constraint exists in the built optimisation problem "backend"

# %%
m.backend.verbose_strings()
m.backend.get_piecewise_constraint("csp_piecewise_costs").to_series().dropna()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Solve the optimisation problem
#
# Once we have all of our optimisation problem components set up as we desire, we can solve the problem.

# %%
m.solve()

# %% [markdown]
# The results are stored in `m._model_data` and can be accessed by the public property `m.results`

# %% [markdown]
# ## Analysing the outputs

# %%
# Absolute
csp_cost = m.results.cost_investment_flow_cap.sel(techs="csp")
csp_cost.to_series().dropna()

# %%
# Relative to capacity
csp_cap = m.results.flow_cap.sel(techs="csp")
csp_cost_rel = csp_cost / csp_cap
csp_cost_rel.to_series().dropna()

# %%
# Plotted on our piecewise curve

# ## YAML model definition
# We have updated the model parameters and math interactively in Python in this tutorial, the definition in YAML would look like:

# %% [markdown]
# ### Math
#
# Saved as e.g., `csp_piecewise_math.yaml`.
#
# ```yaml
# variables:
#   piecewise_cost_investment:
#     description: Investment cost that increases monotonically
#     foreach: [nodes, techs, carriers, costs]
#     where: "[csp] in techs"
#     bounds:
#       min: 0
#       max: .inf
#     default: 0
#
# piecewise_constraints:
#   csp_piecewise_costs:
#     description: >
#       Set investment costs values along a piecewise curve using special ordered sets of type 2 (SOS2).
#     foreach: [nodes, techs, carriers, costs]
#     where: "[csp] in techs"
#     x_expression: flow_cap
#     x_values: capacity_steps
#     y_expression: piecewise_cost_investment
#     y_values: cost_steps
#
# global_expressions:
#   cost_investment_flow_cap.equations:
#     - expression: "$cost_sum * flow_cap"
#       where: "NOT [csp] in techs"
#     - expression: "piecewise_cost_investment"
#       where: "[csp] in techs"
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### Scenario definition
#
# Loaded into the national-scale example model with: `calliope.examples.national_scale(scenario="piecewise_csp_cost")`
#
# ```yaml
# overrides:
#   piecewise_csp_cost:
#     config.init.add_math: [csp_piecewise_math.yaml]
#     parameters:
#       capacity_steps:
#         data: [0, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000]
#         index: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
#         dims: "breakpoints"
#       cost_steps:
#         data: [0, 3.75e6, 6e6, 7.5e6, 8e6]
#         index: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
#         dims: "breakpoints"
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ## Troubleshooting
#
# If you are failing to load a piecewise constraint or it isn't working as expected, here are some common things to note:
#
# 1. The extent of your `x_values` and `y_values` will dictate the maximum values of your piecewise decision variables.
# In this example, we define `capacity_steps` over the full capacity range that we allow our CSP to cover in the model.
# However, if we set `capacity_steps` to `[0, 2500, 5000, 7500, 9000]` then `flow_cap` would _never_ go above a value of 9000.
#
# 2. The `x_values` and `y_values` parameters must have the same number of breakpoints and be indexed over `breakpoints`.
# It is possible to extend these parameters to be indexed over other dimensions (e.g., different technologies with different piecewise curves) but it must _always_ include the `breakpoints` dimension.
#
# 3. `x_values` must increase monotonically. That is, `[0, 5000, 2500, 7500, 10000]` is not valid for `capacity_steps` in this example.
# `y_values`, on the other hand, _can_ vary any way you like; `[0, 6e6, 3.75e6, 8e6, 7.5e6]` is valid for `cost_steps`.
#
# 4. `x_expression` and `y_expression` _must_ include reference to at least one decision variable.
# It can be a math expression, not only a single decision variable. `flow_cap + storage_cap / 2` would be valid for `x_expression` in this example.
#
# 5. Piecewise constraints will make your problem more difficult to solve since each breakpoint adds a binary decision variable.
# Larger models with detailed piecewise constraints may not solve in a reasonable amount of time.
