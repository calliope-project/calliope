# # Running models in different modes
#
# Models can be built and solved in different modes:

# - `plan` mode.
# In `plan` mode, the user defines upper and lower boundaries for technology capacities and the model decides on an optimal system configuration.
# In this configuration, the total cost of investing in technologies and then using them to meet demand in every _timestep_ (e.g., every hour) is as low as possible.
# - `operate` mode.
# In `operate` mode, all capacity constraints are fixed and the system is operated with a receding horizon control algorithm.
# This is sometimes known as a `dispatch` model - we're only concerned with the _dispatch_ of technologies whose capacities are already fixed.
# Optimisation is limited to a time horizon which
# - `spores` mode.
# `SPORES` refers to Spatially-explicit Practically Optimal REsultS.
# This run mode allows a user to generate any number of alternative results which are within a certain range of the optimal cost.

# In this notebook we will run the Calliope national scale example model in these three modes.

# More detail on these modes is given in the [_advanced_ section of the Calliope documentation](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/mode/).
