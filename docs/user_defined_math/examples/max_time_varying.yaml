# title: Time-varying flow limit
#
# description: |
#     Set per-timestep variations in limits to out/inflows, which would otherwise be limited by a static value.
#     For example, `flow_cap` can be made to fluctuate per timestep above/below its rated value.
#     User-defined timeseries parameters need to be in the model inputs for these constraints.
#     This can be achieved by defining them for each relevant technology in a CSV file and loading that as a [data table][loading-tabular-data-data_tables].
#
#     New indexed parameters:
#
#     - `flow_cap_max_relative_per_ts`
#     - `storage_cap_max_relative_per_ts`
#
#     Helper functions used:
#
#     - `sum` (expression)

parameters:
  flow_cap_max_relative_per_ts:
    description: The relative quantity of flow capacity used to limit generator outflow in each timestep.
    default: 1

  storage_cap_max_relative_per_ts:
    description: The relative quantity of storage capacity used to limit generator outflow in each timestep.
    default: 1


constraints:
  max_time_varying_flow_cap:
    description: >
      Limit flow out in each hour according to a time varying fractional limit
      that is multiplied by the technology flow cap. This represents, for
      instance, the impact of outdoor temperature on the maximum output of a
      technology relative to its rated max output.
