# title: Piecewise linear costs - economies of scale
#
# description: |
#     Add a piecewise cost function that reduces the incremental increase in investment costs with increasing technology rated capacity.
#     This emulates "economies of scale", where the more of a technology there is deployed, the less expensive each additional investment in deployment.
#
#     A more detailing example can be found in our [dedicated tutorial][defining-piecewise-linear-constraints].
#
#     New indexed parameters:
#
#     - `piecewise_cost_investment_x` (defining the new set `breakpoints`)
#     - `piecewise_cost_investment_y` (defining the new set `breakpoints`)
