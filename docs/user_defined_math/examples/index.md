# Additional math example gallery

There are many use-cases for additional math that the Calliope team have already explored and applied.
You can find a brief description of these use-cases in this section, along with the YAML math formulation that you can download and use yourself.

If you have introduced your own math to a model that you would like to be included in this gallery for others to use, we would welcome your contribution.
You can open an issue, or even better, a pull request, on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/calliope-project/calliope).

!!! note

    These examples are only tested in a limited fashion and it is up to you, the user, to make sure you understand the maths when you apply them to your own model!
