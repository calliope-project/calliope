# title: CHP plants

# description: |
#   Set Combined heat and power (CHP) plant heat to power operational zones.
#   There are three types of CHP that can be described by the following constraints:
#   1. CHPs with extraction (condensing) turbines, where some electrical efficiency can be sacrificed by diverting high-temperature steam to provide more heat (following the extraction (cv) line).
#   At maximum electrical efficiency, some heat can still be generated from the low-temperature steam output (following the backpressure (cb) line).
#   The following figure shows the 2D plane of electricity and heat generation; there is a third dimension not shown here: fuel consumption.
#
#   ```text
#   Along the cv line, fuel consumption remains constant.

#
#   2. CHPs without extraction turbines, but with auxiliary boilers that can be used to divert fuel use for direct heat generation.
#   At maximum electrical efficiency, some heat can be generated from the low-temperature steam output (following the backpressure (cb) line).
#   For the same fuel input, electricity output can be sacrificed by diverting some fuel to direct use in a boiler, with its own efficiency.
#   This leads to two sources of heat output (E = electricity output): H1 = E / cb; H2 / boiler_eff + E / turbine_eff = fuel_consumption. Total heat output H is then H1 + H2.
#   The following figure shows the 2D plane of electricity and heat generation; there is a third dimension not shown here: fuel consumption.

#
#   3. CHPs without extraction turbines and without an auxiliary boiler.
#   Here, there is no operating region; the output must follow the backpressure line.
