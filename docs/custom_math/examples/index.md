# Custom math example gallery

There are many use-cases for custom math that we have already explored.
You can find a brief description of these use-cases in this section, along with the YAML math formulation that you can download and use yourself.

If you have introduced custom math to your own model that you would like to be included in this gallery for others to use, we would welcome your contribution.

!!! note

    These examples are only tested in a limited fashion and it is up to you, the user, to make sure you understand the maths when you apply them to your own model!
