Advanced features
-----------------

Once you're comfortable with :doc:`building <building>`, :doc:`running <running>`, and :doc:`analysing <analysing>` one of the built-in example models, you may want to explore Calliope's advanced functionality. With these features, you will be able to build and run complex models in no time.

.. _time_clustering:

Time resolution adjustment
--------------------------

Models have a default timestep length (defined implicitly by the timesteps of the model's time series data). This default resolution can be adjusted over parts of the dataset by specifying time resolution adjustment in the model configuration, for example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    model:
        time:
            function: resample
            function_options: {'resolution': '6H'}

In the above example, this would resample all time series data to 6-hourly timesteps.

Calliope's time resolution adjustment functionality allows running a function that can perform arbitrary adjustments to the time series data in the model.

The available options include:

1. Uniform time resolution reduction through the ``resample`` function, which takes a `pandas-compatible rule describing the target resolution <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html>`_ (see above example).

2. Deriving representative days from the input time series, by applying the clustering method implemented in :mod:`calliope.time.clustering`, for example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    model:
        time:
            function: apply_clustering
            function_options:
                clustering_func: kmeans
                how: mean
                k: 20

When using representative days, a number of additional constraints are added, based on the study undertaken by `Kotzur et al <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.023>`_. These constraints require a new decision variable ``storage_inter_cluster``, which tracks storage between all the dates of the original timeseries. This particular functionality can be disabled by including :yaml:`storage_inter_cluster: false` in the `function_options` given above.

.. note::

    It is also possible to load user-defined representative days, by pointing to a file in `clustering_func` in the same format as pointing to timeseries files in constraints, e.g. :yaml:`clustering_func: file=clusters.csv:column_name`. Clusters are unique per datestep, so the clustering file is most readable if the index is at datestep resolution. But, the clustering file index can be in timesteps (e.g. if sharing the same file as a constraint timeseries), with the cluster number repeated per timestep in a day. Cluster values should be integer, starting at zero.

3. Heuristic selection of time steps, that is, the application of one or more of the masks defined in :mod:`calliope.time.masks`, which will mark areas of the time series to retain at maximum resolution (unmasked) and areas where resolution can be lowered (masked). Options can be passed to the masking functions by specifying ``options``. A ``time.function`` can still be specified and will be applied to the masked areas (i.e. those areas of the time series not selected to remain at the maximum resolution), as in this example, which looks for the week of minimum and maximum potential wind generation (assuming a ``wind`` technology was specified), then reduces the rest of the input time series to 6-hourly resolution:

.. code-block:: yaml

    model:
        time:
            masks:
                - {function: extreme, options: {padding: 'calendar_week', tech: 'wind', how: 'max'}}
                - {function: extreme, options: {padding: 'calendar_week', tech: 'wind', how: 'min'}}
            function: resample
            function_options: {'resolution': '6H'}

.. Warning::

  When using time clustering or time masking, the resulting timesteps will be assigned different weights depending on how long a period of time they represent. Weights are used for example to give appropriate weight to the operational costs of aggregated typical days in comparison to individual extreme days, if both exist in the same processed time series. The weighting is accessible in the model data, e.g. through :python:`model.inputs.timestep_weights`. The interpretation of results when weights are not 1 for all timesteps requires caution. Production values are not scaled according to weights, but costs are multiplied by weight, in order to weight different timesteps appropriately in the objective function. This means that costs and production values are not consistent without manually post-processing them by either multipyling production by weight (production would then be inconsistent with capacity) or dividing costs by weight. The computation of levelised costs and of capacity factors takes weighting into account, so these values are consisten and can be used as usual.

.. seealso::

  See the implementation of constraints in :mod:`calliope.backend.pyomo.constraints` for more detail on timestep weights and how they affect model constraints.

Setting a random seed
---------------------

By specifying :yaml:`model.random_seed` in the model configuration, any alphanumeric string can be used to initialise the random number generator at the very start of model processing.

This is useful for full reproducibility of model results where time series clustering is used, as clustering methods such as k-means depend on randomly generated initial conditions.

Note that this affects only the random number generator used in Calliope's model preprocessing and not in any way the solver used to solve the model (any solver-specific options need to be set specifically for that solver; see :ref:`solver_options`).

.. _tech_groups:

Using ``tech_groups`` to group configuration
--------------------------------------------

In a large model, several very similar technologies may exist, for example, different kinds of PV technologies with slightly different cost data or with different potentials at different model locations.

To make it easier to specify closely related technologies, ``tech_groups`` can be used to specify configuration shared between multiple technologies. The technologies then give the ``tech_group`` as their parent, rather than one of the abstract base technologies.

You can as well extend abstract base technologies, by adding an attribute that will be in effect for all technologies derived from the base technology. To do so, use the name of the abstract base technology for your group, but omit the parent.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    tech_groups:
        supply:
            constraints:
                monetary:
                    interest_rate: 0.1
        pv:
            essentials:
                parent: supply
                carrier: power
            constraints:
                resource: file=pv_resource.csv
                lifetime: 30
            costs:
                monetary:
                    om_annual_investment_fraction: 0.05
                    depreciation_rate: 0.15

    techs:
        pv_large_scale:
            essentials:
                parent: pv
                name: 'Large-scale PV'
            constraints:
                energy_cap_max: 2000
            costs:
                monetary:
                    energy_cap: 750
        pv_rooftop:
            essentials:
                parent: pv
                name: 'Rooftop PV'
            constraints:
                energy_cap_max: 10000
            costs:
                monetary:
                    energy_cap: 1000

None of the ``tech_groups`` appear in model results, they are only used to group model configuration values.


.. _removing_techs_locations:

Removing techs, locations and links
-----------------------------------

By specifying :yaml:`exists: false` in the model configuration, which can be done for example through overrides, model components can be removed for debugging or scenario analysis.

This works for:

* Techs: :yaml:`techs.tech_name.exists: false`
* Locations: :yaml:`locations.location_name.exists: false`
* Links: :yaml:`links.location1,location2.exists: false`
* Techs at a specific location:  :yaml:`locations.location_name.techs.tech_name.exists: false`
* Transmission techs at a specific location: :yaml:`links.location1,location2.techs.transmission_tech.exists: false`
* Group constraints: :yaml:`group_constraints.my_constraint.exists: false`

.. _operational_mode:

Operational mode
----------------

In planning mode, constraints are given as upper and lower boundaries and the model decides on an optimal system configuration. In operational mode, all capacity constraints are fixed and the system is operated with a receding horizon control algorithm.

To specify a runnable operational model, capacities for all technologies at all locations must have be defined. This can be done by specifying ``energy_cap_equals``. In the absence of ``energy_cap_equals``, constraints given as ``energy_cap_max`` are assumed to be fixed in operational mode.

Operational mode runs a model with a receding horizon control algorithm. This requires two additional settings:

.. code-block:: yaml

    run:
        operation:
            horizon: 48  # hours
            window: 24  # hours

``horizon`` specifies how far into the future the control algorithm optimises in each iteration. ``window`` specifies how many of the hours within ``horizon`` are actually used. In the above example, decisions on how to operate for each 24-hour window are made by optimising over 48-hour horizons (i.e., the second half of each optimisation run is discarded). For this reason, ``horizon`` must always be larger than ``window``.

.. _generating_scripts:

Generating scripts to run a model many times
--------------------------------------------

:ref:`Scenarios and overrides <building_overrides>` can be used to run a given model multiple times with slightly changed settings or constraints.

This functionality can be used together with the :sh:`calliope generate_runs` and :sh:`calliope generate_scenarios` command-line tools to generate scripts that run a model many times over in a fully automated way, for example, to explore the effect of different technology costs on model results.

:sh:`calliope generate_runs`, at a minimum, must be given the following arguments:

* the model configuration file to use
* the name of the script to create
* :sh:`--kind`: Currently, three options are available. ``windows`` creates a Windows batch (``.bat``) script that runs all models sequentially, ``bash`` creates an equivalent script to run on Linux or macOS, ``bsub`` creates a submission script for a LSF-based high-performance cluster, and ``sbatch`` creates a submission script for a SLURM-based high-performance cluster.
* :sh:`--scenarios`: A semicolon-separated list of scenarios (or overrides/combinations of overrides) to generate scripts for, for example, ``scenario1;scenario2`` or ``override1,override2a;override1,override2b``. Note that when not using manually defined scenario names, a comma is used to group overrides together into a single model -- in the above example, ``override1,override2a`` would be applied to the first run and ``override1,override2b`` be applied to the second run

A fully-formed command generating a Windows batch script to run a model four times with each of the scenarios "run1", "run2", "run3", and "run4":

.. code-block:: shell

    calliope generate_runs model.yaml run_model.bat --kind=windows --scenarios "run1;run2;run3;run4"

Optional arguments are:

* :sh:`--cluster_threads`: specifies the number of threads to request on a HPC cluster
* :sh:`--cluster_mem`: specifies the memory to request on a HPC cluster
* :sh:`--cluster_time`: specifies the run time to request on a HPC cluster
* :sh:`--additional_args`: A text string of any additional arguments to pass directly through to :sh:`calliope run` in the generated scripts, for example, :sh:`--additional_args="--debug"`.
* :sh:`--debug`: Print additional debug information when running the run generation script.

An example generating a script to run on a ``bsub``-type high-performance cluster, with additional arguments to specify the resources to request from the cluster:

.. code-block:: shell

    calliope generate_runs model.yaml submit_runs.sh --kind=bsub --cluster_mem=1G --cluster_time=100 --cluster_threads=5  --scenarios "run1;run2;run3;run4"

Running this will create two files:

* ``submit_runs.sh``: The cluster submission script to pass to ``bsub`` on the cluster.
* ``submit_runs.array.sh``: The accompanying script defining the runs for the cluster to execute.

In all cases, results are saved into the same directory as the script, with filenames of the form ``out_{run_number}_{scenario_name}.nc`` (model results) and ``plots_{run_number}_{scenario_name}.html`` (HTML plots), where ``{run_number}`` is the run number and ``{scenario_name}`` is the name of the scenario (or the string defining the overrides applied). On a cluster, log files are saved to files with names starting with ``log_`` in the same directory.

Finally, the :sh:`calliope generate_scenarios` tool can be used to quickly generate a file with ``scenarios`` definition for inclusion in a model, if a large enough number of overrides exist to make it tedious to manually combine them into scenarios. Assuming that in ``model.yaml`` a range of overrides exist that specify a subset of time for the years 2000 through 2010, called "y2000" through "y2010", and a set of cost-related overrides called "cost_low", "cost_medium" and "cost_high", the following command would generate scenarios with combinations of all years and cost overrides, calling them "run_1", "run_2", and so on, and saving them to ``scenarios.yaml``:

.. code-block:: shell

    calliope generate_scenarios model.yaml scenarios.yaml y2000;y2001;y2002;2003;y2004;y2005;y2006;2007;2008;y2009;2010 cost_low;cost_medium;cost_high --scenario_name_prefix="run_"


.. _imports_in_override_groups:

Importing other YAML files in overrides
---------------------------------------

When using overrides (see :ref:`building_overrides`), it is possible to have ``import`` statements within overrides for more flexibility. The following example illustrates this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    overrides:
        some_override:
            techs:
                some_tech.constraints.energy_cap_max: 10
            import: [additional_definitions.yaml]

``additional_definitions.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    techs:
        some_other_tech.constraints.energy_eff: 0.1

This is equivalent to the following override:

.. code-block:: yaml

    overrides:
        some_override:
            techs:
                some_tech.constraints.energy_cap_max: 10
                some_other_tech.constraints.energy_eff: 0.1

.. _backend_interface:

Interfacing with the solver backend
-----------------------------------

On loading a model, there is no solver backend, only the input dataset. The backend is generated when a user calls `run()` on their model. Currently this will call back to Pyomo to build the model and send it off to the solver, given by the user in the run configuration :yaml:`run.solver`. Once built, solved, and returned, the user has access to the results dataset :python:`model.results` and interface functions with the backend :python:`model.backend`.

You can use this interface to:

1. Get the raw data on the inputs used in the optimisation.
    By running :python:`model.backend.get_input_params()` a user get an xarray Dataset which will look very similar to :python:`model.inputs`, except that assumed default values will be included. You may also spot a bug, where a value in :python:`model.inputs` is different to the value returned by this function.

2. Update a parameter value.
    If you are interested in updating a few values in the model, you can run :python:`model.backend.update_param()`. For example, to update the energy efficiency of your `ccgt` technology in location `region1` from 0.5 to 0.1, you can run :python:`model.backend.update_param('energy_eff', {'region1::ccgt`: 0.1})`. This will not affect results at this stage, you'll need to rerun the backend (point 4) to optimise with these new values.

.. note:: If you are interested in updating the objective function cost class weights, you will need to set 'objective_cost_class' as the parameter, e.g. :python:`model.backend.update_param('objective_cost_class', {'monetary': 0.5})`.

3. Activate / Deactivate a constraint or objective.
    Constraints can be activated and deactivate such that they will or will not have an impact on the optimisation. All constraints are active by default, but you might like to remove, for example, a capacity constraint if you don't want there to be a capacity limit for any technologies. Similarly, if you had multiple objectives, you could deactivate one and activate another. The result would be to have a different objective when rerunning the backend.

.. note:: Currently Calliope does not allow you to build multiple objectives, you will need to `understand Pyomo <http://www.pyomo.org/documentation/>`_ and add an additional objective yourself to make use of this functionality. The Pyomo ConcreteModel() object can be accessed at :python:`model._backend_model`.

4. Rerunning the backend.
    If you have edited parameters or constraint activation, you will need to rerun the optimisation to propagate the effects. By calling :python:`model.backend.rerun()`, the optimisation will run again, with the updated backend. This will not affect your model, but instead will return a new calliope Model object associated with that *specific* rerun. You can analyse the results and inputs in this new model, but there is no backend interface available. You'll need to return to the original model to access the backend again, or run the returned model using :python:`new_model.run(force_rerun=True)`. In the original model, :python:`model.results` will not change, and can only be overwritten by :python:`model.run(force_rerun=True)`.

.. note:: By calling :python:`model.run(force_rerun=True)` any updates you have made to the backend will be overwritten.

.. seealso:: :ref:`api_backend_interface`

.. _solver_options:

Specifying custom solver options
--------------------------------

Gurobi
^^^^^^

Refer to the `Gurobi manual <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/>`_, which contains a list of parameters. Simply use the names given in the documentation (e.g. "NumericFocus" to set the numerical focus value). For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    run:
        solver: gurobi
        solver_options:
            Threads: 3
            NumericFocus: 2

CPLEX
^^^^^

Refer to the `CPLEX parameter list <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS9UKU_12.5.0/com.ibm.cplex.zos.help/Parameters/topics/introListAlpha.html>`_. Use the "Interactive" parameter names, replacing any spaces with underscores (for example, the memory reduction switch is called "emphasis memory", and thus becomes "emphasis_memory"). For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    run:
        solver: cplex
        solver_options:
            mipgap: 0.01
            mip_polishafter_absmipgap: 0.1
            emphasis_mip: 1
            mip_cuts: 2
            mip_cuts_cliques: 3
