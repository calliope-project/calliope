Building a model
================

In short, a Calliope model works like this: **supply technologies** can take a **resource** from outside of the modeled system and turn it into a specific energy **carrier** in the system. The model specifies one or more **locations** along with the technologies allowed at those locations. **Transmission technologies** can move energy of the same carrier from one location to another, while **conversion technologies** can convert one carrier into another at the same location. **Demand technologies** remove energy from the system, while **storage technologies** can store energy at a specific location. Putting all of these possibilities together allows a modeller to specify as simple or as complex a model as necessary to answer a given research question.

In more technical terms, Calliope allows a modeller to define technologies with arbitrary characteristics by "inheriting" basic traits from a number of included base tech groups -- ``supply``, ``supply_plus``, ``demand``, ``conversion``, ``conversion_plus``, and ``transmission``. These groups are described in more detail in :ref:`abstract_base_tech_definitions`.

-----------
Terminology
-----------

The terminology defined here is used throughout the documentation and the model code and configuration files:

* **Technology**: a technology that produces, consumes, converts or transports energy
* **Location**: a site which can contain multiple technologies and which may contain other locations for energy balancing purposes
* **Resource**: a source or sink of energy that can (or must) be used by a technology to introduce into or remove energy from the system
* **Carrier**: an energy carrier that groups technologies together into the same network, for example ``electricity`` or ``heat``.

As more generally in constrained optimisation, the following terms are also used:

* Parameter: a fixed coefficient that enters into model equations
* Variable: a variable coefficient (decision variable) that enters into model equations
* Set: an index in the algebraic formulation of the equations
* Constraint: an equality or inequality expression that constrains one or several variables

-------------------------
Files that define a model
-------------------------

Calliope models are defined through YAML files, which are both human-readable and computer-readable, and CSV files (a simple tabular format) for time series data.

It makes sense to collect all files belonging to a model inside a single model directory. The layout of that directory typically looks roughly like this (``+`` denotes directories, ``-`` files):

.. code-block:: text

    + example_model
        + model_config
            - locations.yaml
            - techs.yaml
        + timeseries_data
            - solar_resource.csv
            - electricity_demand.csv
        - model.yaml
        - scenarios.yaml

In the above example, the files ``model.yaml``, ``locations.yaml`` and ``techs.yaml`` together are the model definition. This definition could be in one file, but it is more readable when split into multiple. We use the above layout in the example models and in our research!

Inside the ``timeseries_data`` directory, timeseries are stored as CSV files. The location of this directory can be specified in the model configuration, e.g. in ``model.yaml``.

.. Note::

    The easiest way to create a new model is to use the ``calliope new`` command, which makes a copy of one of the built-in examples models::

    $ calliope new my_new_model

    This creates a new directory, ``my_new_model``, in the current working directory.

    By default, ``calliope new`` uses the national-scale example model as a template. To use a different template, you can specify the example model to use, e.g.: ``--template=urban_scale``.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`yaml_format`, :doc:`ref_example_models`, :ref:`configuration_timeseries`

-------------------------------
Model configuration (``model``)
-------------------------------

The model configuration specifies all aspects of the model to run. It is structured into several top-level headings (keys in the YAML file): ``model``, ``techs``, ``locations``, ``links``, and ``run``. We will discuss each of these in turn, starting with ``model``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    model:
        name: 'My energy model'
        timeseries_data_path: 'timeseries_data'
        reserve_margin:
            power: 0
        subset_time: ['2005-01-01', '2005-01-05']

Besides the model's name (``name``) and the path for CSV time series data (``timeseries_data_path``), group constraints can be set, like ``reserve_margin``.

To speed up model runs, the above example specifies a time subset to run the model over only five days of time series data (``subset_time: ['2005-01-01', '2005-01-05']``)-- this is entirely optional. Usually, a full model will contain at least one year of data, but subsetting time can be useful to speed up a model for testing purposes.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`National scale example model <examplemodels_nationalscale_settings>`, :ref:`config_reference_model`

------------------------
Technologies (``techs``)
------------------------

The ``techs`` section in the model configuration specifies all of the model's technologies. In our current example, this is in a separate file, ``model_config/techs.yaml``, which is imported into the main ``model.yaml`` file alongside the file for locations described further below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    import:
        - 'model_config/techs.yaml'
        - 'model_config/locations.yaml'

.. Note:: The ``import`` statement can specify a list of paths to additional files to import (the imported files, in turn, may include further files, so arbitrary degrees of nested configurations are possible). The ``import`` statement can either give an absolute path or a path relative to the importing file.

The following example shows the definition of a ``ccgt`` technology, i.e. a combined cycle gas turbine that delivers electricity:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ccgt:
        essentials:
            name: 'Combined cycle gas turbine'
            color: '#FDC97D'
            parent: supply
            carrier_out: power
        constraints:
            resource: inf
            energy_eff: 0.5
            energy_cap_max: 40000  # kW
            energy_cap_max_systemwide: 100000  # kW
            energy_ramping: 0.8
            lifetime: 25
        costs:
            monetary:
                interest_rate: 0.10
                energy_cap: 750  # USD per kW
                om_con: 0.02  # USD per kWh

Each technology must specify some ``essentials``, most importantly a name, the abstract base technology it is inheriting from (``parent``), and its energy carrier (``carrier_out`` in the case of a ``supply`` technology). Specifying a ``color`` is optional but useful for using the built-in visualisation tools (see :doc:`analysing`).

The ``constraints`` section gives all constraints for the technology, such as allowed capacities, conversion efficiencies, the life time (used in levelised cost calculations), and the resource it consumes (in the above example, the resource is set to infinite via ``inf``).

The ``costs`` section gives costs for the technology. Calliope uses the concept of "cost classes" to allow accounting for more than just monetary costs. The above example specifies only the ``monetary`` cost class, but any number of other classes could be used, for example ``co2`` to account for emissions. Additional cost classes can be created simply by adding them to the definition of costs for a technology.

By default, only the ``monetary`` cost class is used in the objective function, i.e., the default objective is to minimize total costs.

Multiple cost classes can be considered in the objective by setting the `cost_class` key. It must be a dictionary of cost classes and their weights in the objective, e.g. ``objective_options: {'cost_class': {'monetary': 1, 'emissions': 0.1}}``. In this example, monetary costs are summed as usual and emissions are added to this, scaled by 0.1 (emulating a carbon price).

To use a different sense (minimize/maximize) you can set `sense`: ``objective_options: {'cost_class': ..., 'sense': 'minimize'}``.

To use a single alternative cost class, disabling the consideration of the default `monetary`, set the weight of the monetary cost class to zero to stop considering it and the weight of another cost class to a non-zero value, e.g. ``objective_options: {'cost_class': {'monetary': 0, 'emissions': 1}}``.

Allowing for unmet demand
-------------------------

For a model to find a feasible solution, supply must always be able to meet demand. To avoid the solver failing to find a solution, you can ensure feasibility:

.. code-block:: yaml

    run:
        ensure_feasibility: true

This will create an ``unmet_demand`` decision variable in the optimisation, which can pick up any mismatch between supply and demand, across all energy carriers. It has a very high cost associated with its use, so it will only appear when absolutely necessary.

.. note::
    When ensuring feasibility, you can also set a `big M value <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_M_method>`_ (``run.bigM``). This is the "cost" of unmet demand. It is possible to make model convergence very slow if bigM is set too high. default bigM is 1x10 :sup:`9`, but should be close to the maximum total system cost that you can imagine. This is perhaps closer to 1x10 :sup:`6` for urban scale models.

.. _configuration_timeseries:

----------------
Time series data
----------------

.. Note::

   If a parameter is not explicit in time and space, it can be specified as a single value in the model definition (or, using location-specific definitions, be made spatially explicit). This applies both to parameters that never vary through time (for example, cost of installed capacity) and for those that may be time-varying (for example, a technology's available resource). However, each model must contain at least one time series.


For parameters that vary in time, time series data can be read from CSV files, by specifying ``resource: file=filename.csv`` to pick the desired CSV file from within the configured timeseries data path (``model.timeseries_data_path``).

By default, Calliope looks for a column in the CSV file with the same name as the location. It is also possible to specify a column to use when setting ``resource`` per location, by giving the column name with a colon following the filename: ``resource: file=filename.csv:column``

For example, a simple photovoltaic (PV) tech using a time series of hour-by-hour electricity generation data might look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pv:
        essentials:
            name: 'Rooftop PV'
            color: '#B59C2B'
            parent: supply
            carrier_out: power
        constraints:
            resource: file=pv_resource.csv
            energy_cap_max: 10000  # kW

By default, Calliope expects time series data in a model to be indexed by ISO 8601 compatible time stamps in the format ``YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss``, e.g. ``2005-01-01 00:00:00``. This can be changed by setting ``model.timeseries_dateformat`` based on ``strftime` directives <http://strftime.org/>`_, which defaults to ``'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'``.

For example, the first few lines of a CSV file giving a resource potential for two locations might look like this, with the first column in the file always being read as the date-time index:

.. code-block:: text

    ,location1,location2
    2005-01-01 00:00:00,0,0
    2005-01-01 01:00:00,0,11
    2005-01-01 02:00:00,0,18
    2005-01-01 03:00:00,0,49
    2005-01-01 04:00:00,11,110
    2005-01-01 05:00:00,45,300
    2005-01-01 06:00:00,90,458

----------------------------------------------
Locations and links (``locations``, ``links``)
----------------------------------------------

A model can specify any number of locations. These locations are linked together by transmission technologies. By consuming an energy carrier in one location and outputting it in another, linked location, transmission technologies allow resources to be drawn from the system at a different location from where they are brought into it.

The ``locations`` section specifies each location:

.. code-block:: yaml

    locations:
        region1:
            coordinates: {lat: 40, lon: -2}
            techs:
                unmet_demand_power:
                demand_power:
                ccgt:
                    constraints:
                        energy_cap_max: 30000

Locations can optionally specify ``coordinates`` (used in visualisation or to compute distance between them) and must specify ``techs`` allowed at that location. As seen in the example above, each allowed tech must be listed, and can optionally specify additional location-specific parameters (constraints or costs). If given, location-specific parameters supersede any group constraints a technology defines in the ``techs`` section for that location.

The ``links`` section specifies possible transmission links between locations in the form ``location1,location2``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    links:
        region1,region2:
            techs:
                ac_transmission:
                    constraints:
                        energy_cap_max: 10000
                    costs.monetary:
                        energy_cap: 100

In the above example, an high-voltage AC transmission line is specified to connect ``region1`` with ``region2``. For this to work, a ``transmission`` technology called ``ac_transmission`` must have previously been defined in the model's ``techs`` section. There, it can be given group constraints or costs. As in the case of locations, the ``links`` section can specify per-link parameters (constraints or costs) that supersede any model-wide parameters.

The modeller can also specify a distance for each link, and use per-distance constraints and costs for transmission technologies.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`config_reference_constraints`, :ref:`config_reference_costs`.

---------------------------
Run configuration (``run``)
---------------------------

The only required setting in the run configuration is the solver to use:

.. code-block:: yaml

    run:
        solver: cbc
        mode: plan

the most important parts of the ``run`` section are ``solver`` and  ``mode``. A model can run either in planning mode (``plan``) or operational mode (``operate``). In planning mode, capacities are determined by the model, whereas in operational mode, capacities are fixed and the system is operated with a receding horizon control algorithm.

Possible options for solver include ``glpk``, ``gurobi``, ``cplex``, and ``cbc``. The interface to these solvers is done through the Pyomo library. Any `solver compatible with Pyomo <https://software.sandia.gov/downloads/pub/pyomo/PyomoInstallGuide.html#Solvers>`_ should work with Calliope.

For solvers with which Pyomo provides more than one way to interface, the additional ``solver_io`` option can be used. In the case of Gurobi, for example, it is usually fastest to use the direct Python interface:

.. code-block:: yaml

    run:
        solver: gurobi
        solver_io: python

.. note:: The opposite is currently true for CPLEX, which runs faster with the default ``solver_io``.

Further optional settings, including debug settings, can be specified in the run configuration.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`config_reference_run`, :doc:`troubleshooting`, :ref:`solver_options`, :ref:`documentation on operational mode <operational_mode>`.

.. _building_overrides:

-----------------------
Scenarios and overrides
-----------------------

To make it easier to run a given model multiple times with slightly changed settings or constraints, for example, varying the cost of a key technology, it is possible to define and apply scenarios and overrides. "Overrides" are blocks of YAML that specify configurations that expand or override parts of the base model. "Scenarios" are combinations of any number of such overrides. Both are specified at the top level of the model configuration, as in this example ``model.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    scenarios:
        high_cost_2005: ["high_cost", "year2005"]
        high_cost_2006: ["high_cost", "year2006"]

    overrides:
        high_cost:
            techs.onshore_wind.costs.monetary.energy_cap: 2000
        year2005:
            model.subset_time: ['2005-01-01', '2005-12-31']
        year2006:
            model.subset_time: ['2006-01-01', '2006-12-31']

    model:
        ...

    run:
        ...

Each override is given by a name (e.g. ``high_cost``) and any number of model settings -- anything in the model configuration can be overridden by an override. In the above example, one override defines higher costs for an ``onshore_wind`` tech while the two other overrides specify different time subsets, so would run an otherwise identical model over two different periods of time series data.

One or several overrides can be applied when running a model, as described in :doc:`running`. Overrides can also be combined into scenarios to make applying them at run-time easier. Scenarios consist of a name and a list of override names which together form that scenario.

Scenarios and overrides can be used to generate scripts that run a single Calliope model many times, either sequentially, or in parallel on a high-performance cluster (see :ref:`generating_scripts`).

.. note::
    Overrides can also import other files. This can be useful if many overrides are defined which share large parts of model configuration, such as different levels of interconnection between model zones. See :ref:`imports_in_override_groups` for details.

.. seealso:: :ref:`generating_scripts`, :ref:`imports_in_override_groups`
