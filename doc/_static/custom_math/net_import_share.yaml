# Force upper limit on carrier imports within nodes or across all nodes as a share of all carrier flows at a node/across nodes.
# Imports of transmission technologies are defined by `flow_out` (outflow from a transmission technology that originated in a remote node).
# We assume that transmission technologies `test_transmission_elec` and `test_transmission_heat` have been defined.

# New top-level parameters:
# net_import_share

# helper functions used:
# defined (where)
# sum (expression)
# get_transmission_techs (expression)
