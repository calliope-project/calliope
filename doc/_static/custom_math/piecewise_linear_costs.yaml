# Add a piecewise cost function that steadily increases investment costs with increasing technology rated capacity.
# This requires the user to switch on the binary purchase decision variable for any relevant technology.
# Without the purchase decision variable, the technology will have non-zero costs irrespective even if the technology capacity is zero.

# New top-level parameters:
# cost_flow_cap_piecewise_slopes (defining the new parameter `pieces`)
# cost_flow_cap_piecewise_intercept (defining the new parameter `pieces`)

      Since the model is cost minimising, this is equivalent to forcing the investment cost to a specific point along the curve that is traced by the superposition of all pieces.
