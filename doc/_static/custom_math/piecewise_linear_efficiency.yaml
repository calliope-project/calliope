# Add a piecewise technology efficiency function that steadily increases technology efficiency as outflow increases.
# This requires the user to switch on the integer operating_units decision variable for any relevant technology.
# Without the operating_units decision variable, the technology will have non-zero inflow requirements even if the technology capacity is zero and it has no outflow.

# New top-level parameters:
# flow_eff_piecewise_slopes (defining the new parameter `pieces`)
# flow_eff_piecewise_intercept (defining the new parameter `pieces`)

      Limit the lower bound of inflow requirements to monotonically increasing values as the quantity of technology outflow increases.
      Since the model is cost minimising and higher inflows translate to higher costs (because more carrier flow is needed in the system), this is equivalent to forcing the inflow to a specific point along the curve that is traced by the superposition of all pieces.
