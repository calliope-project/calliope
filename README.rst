About
-----

Calliope is a framework to develop energy system models, with a focus on flexibility, high spatial and temporal resolution, the ability to execute many runs based on the same base model, and a clear separation of framework (code) and model (data).

A model based on Calliope consists of a collection of text files (in YAML and CSV formats) that define the technologies, locations and resource potentials. Calliope takes these files, constructs an optimization problem, solves it, and reports results in the form of `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ and `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/>`_ data structures for easy analysis with Calliope's built-in tools or the standard Python data analysis stack.

A simple example model is `included with Calliope <calliope/example_model>`_.

A more elaborate example is `UK-Calliope <https://github.com/sjpfenninger/uk-calliope>`_, which models the power system of Great Britain (England+Scotland+Wales).

Quick start
-----------

Calliope can be run from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ calliope new example  # Create a copy of the example model, in the `example` dir

    $ calliope run example/run.yaml  # Run the model by pointing to its run configuration file

It can also be run interactively from a Python session:

.. code-block:: python

    import calliope
    model = calliope.Model('path/to/run.yaml')
    model.run()
    solution = model.solution  # An xarray.Dataset
