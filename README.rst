About
-----

Calliope is a framework to develop energy system models, with a focus on flexibility, high spatial and temporal resolution, the ability to execute many runs based on the same base model, and a clear separation of framework (code) and model (data).

A Calliope model consists of a collection of text files (in YAML and CSV formats) that fully define a model, with details on technologies, locations, resource potentials, etc. Calliope takes these files, constructs an optimization problem, solves it, and reports back results. Results can be saved to CSV or NetCDF files for further processing, or analysed directly in Python through Python's extensive scientific data processing capabilities provided by libraries like `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ and `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/>`_.

Calliope comes with several built-in analysis and visualisation tools. Having some knowledge of the Python programming language helps when running Calliope and using these tools, but is not a prerequisite.

Quick start
-----------

Calliope can run on Windows, macOS and Linux. Installing it is quickest with the ``conda`` package manager by running a single command: ``conda create -c conda-forge -n calliope python=3.6 calliope``. See the documentation for more `information on installing <https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installation.html>`_.

Several easy to understand example models are `included with Calliope <calliope/example_models>`_ and accessible through the ``calliope.examples`` submodule.

The `tutorials in the documentation run through these examples <https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/tutorials.html>`_. A good place to start is to look at these tutorials to get a feel for how Calliope works, and then to read the "Introduction", "Building a model", "Running a model", and "Analysing a model" sections in the online documentation.

A fully-featured example model is `UK-Calliope <https://github.com/sjpfenninger/uk-calliope>`_, which models the power system of Great Britain (England+Scotland+Wales), and has been used in several peer-reviewed scientific publications.
