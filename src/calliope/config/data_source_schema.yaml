description: All options available to load model definition data from file.

additionalProperties: false
required: ["source"]
$defs:
  DataSourceVals:
    oneOf:
      - type: "null"
      - type: string
        pattern: '^[^_^\d][\w]*$'
      - type: array
        uniqueItems: true
        items:
          type: string
          pattern: '^[^_^\d][\w]*$'

properties:
  rows:
    description: >-
      Names of dimensions defined row-wise.
      Each name should correspond to a column in your data that contains index items.
      These columns must be to the left of the columns containing your data.
    $ref: "#/$defs/DataSourceVals"
  columns:
    description:  >-
      Names of dimensions defined column-wise.
      Each name should correspond to a row in your data that contains index items.
      These rows must be above the rows containing your data.
    $ref: "#/$defs/DataSourceVals"
  source:
    description: >-
      Relative or absolute filepath.
      If relative, will be relative to the model config file used to initialise the model.
    type: string
  select:
    type: object
    description: >-
      Select one or more index item from a dimension.
      Selection takes place before `drop` and `add_dimensions`,
      so you can select a single value from a data dimension and then drop the dimension so it doesn't find its way through to the final dataset.
    properties:
      '^[^_^\d][\w]*$':
        OneOf:
          - type: [string, boolean, number]
          - type: array
            items:
              type: [string, boolean, number]
  drop:
    type: [string, array]
    $ref: "#/$defs/DataSourceVals"
    description: >-
      Dimensions in the rows and/or columns that contain metadata and should therefore not be passed on to the loaded model dataset.
      These could include comments on the source of the data, the data license, or the parameter units.
      You can also drop a dimension and then reintroduce it in `add_dimensions`, but with different index items.
  add_dimensions:
    description: >-
      Data dimensions to add after loading in the array.
      These allow you to use the same file to assign values to different parameters/dimension index items
      (e.g., setting `flow_cap_min` and `flow_cap_max` to the same value),
      or to add a dimension which would otherwise be a column containing the same information in each row
      (e.g., assigning the cost class to monetary for a file containing cost data).
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false
    patternProperties:
      '^[^_^\d][\w]*$':
        type: [string, array]
        description: Keys are dimension names (must not be in `rows` or `columns`), values are index items of that dimension to add.
