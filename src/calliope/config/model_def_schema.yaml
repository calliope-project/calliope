              !!! note
                  If `cap_method` = continuous (which is set by default), then setting `flow_cap_min` to any value greater than 0 forces the model to always respect that limit, which in turn forces investment into the technology.
                  Use this to enforce given investment plans, or to account for existing technologies that cannot be decommissioned.

                  An example: If `cap_method` = continuous and `flow_cap_min` = 100, then flow_cap has to be at least 100.
                  This means that going to 0 is not possible, unless you switch to `cap_method` = integer (see [cap_method][]).
