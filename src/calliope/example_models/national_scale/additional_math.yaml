constraints:
  total_system_cost_max:
    description: >
      Limit total system cost. Conceived for use in SPORES mode to apply a maximum
      relaxation to the system cost compared to the least-cost feasible option.
    equations:
      - expression: sum(cost[costs=monetary], over=[nodes, techs]) <= spores_cost_max * (1 + spores_slack)
