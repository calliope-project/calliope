# Constraints and variables to improve the representation of storage technologies in a model using time clustering to optimise using representative days.
# Although the pattern of storage fluctuations is fixed for all days linked to a specific representative day,
# an excess or deficit of stored carrier can exist at the end of each of these days and can be utilised by the next representative day in the timeseries.

      Stored carrier can be negative so long as it does not go below the carrier stored in `storage_inter_cluster`.
      Only together with `storage_inter_cluster` does this variable's values gain physical significance.
