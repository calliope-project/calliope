    description: |
      Integer number of a technology that has been purchased,

      if `flow_cap_max` == `flow_cap_min`) and/or to set a fixed cost for a technology,
      irrespective of its installed capacity.
      On top of a fixed technology cost,
      a continuous cost for the quantity of installed capacity can still be applied.

      Since technology capacity is no longer a continuous decision variable,
      it is possible for these technologies to have a lower bound set on outflow/consumption
      which will only be enforced in those timesteps that the technology is operating.
      Otherwise, the same lower bound forces the technology to produce/consume
      that minimum amount of carrier in *every* timestep.

      It is expected to only be used when `purchased_units_max == 1`,
      i.e., the `purchased_units` decision variable is binary.
