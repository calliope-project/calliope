All three time series give heat output in kW per m2 solar field, based on free 2005 DNI data from `HelioClim <http://www.soda-is.com/eng/helioclim/index.html>`_ (HC3v2), processed with the CSP plant model described by [#gauche]_.


``demand-1.csv`` and ``demand-2.csv``
-------------------------------------

Both time series are based on modified data from the IIASA GAINS model database [#gains]_.
