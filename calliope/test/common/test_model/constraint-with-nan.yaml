    # A very simple constraint: For each tech, let the annual and regional sum of `carrier_prod` be larger than 100.
    # However, not every tech has the variable `carrier_prod`.
    # How to solve it? Let the constraint be active only where carrier_prod exists by setting 'where' accordingly.
    foreach: [techs]
    equation: "sum(carrier_prod, over=[nodes, timesteps]) >= 100"
    # where: "carrier_prod"
